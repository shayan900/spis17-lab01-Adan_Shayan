If Picobot is in state 0 and has a wall to the north, and an empty space to the west, it will move to the west and remain in state 0. If Picobot is in state 1, and has an empty space to the north and south, it will move to the north and change to state 2. 
An asterisk represents either an empty space or a wall, and an x represents only an empty space. 
0 N*** -> N 0 
If the X is replaced with a W, the Picobot does not retrace its steps going north. 

0 **x* -> W 0   
0 **W* -> N 1 
1 *x** -> E 1   
1 *E** -> N 0
