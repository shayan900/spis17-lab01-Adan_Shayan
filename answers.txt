Describe the given rules in English: If Picobot is in state 0 and has a wall to the north, and an empty space to the west, it will move to the west and remain in state 0. If Picobot is in state 1, and has an empty space to the north and south, it will move to the north and change to state 2. 
What is the difference between the “*” and the “x” in the description of Picobot’s surroundings? An asterisk represents either an empty space or a wall, and an x represents only an empty space. 
Write a Picobot rule that would cause Picobot to crash into a wall (Picobot will report an error if you try this)- 0 N*** -> N 0 
In the Picobot simulator, what will happen if we replace the “X” in the fourth (i.e., last) starting rule with a W. First try to predict, and then run the simulation to see what happens.     If the X is replaced with a W, the Picobot does not retrace its steps going north. 

0 **x* -> W 0   
0 **W* -> N 1 
1 *x** -> E 1   
1 *E** -> N 0
